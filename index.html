    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="about-me">This is the paragraph about me. Once I figure out how to build this page I'll go ahead and add an actual paragraph. In the meantime here's a paragraph about Neil Diamond from his Wikipedia page. Diamond has always had a somewhat polarizing effect, best exemplified by the 1991 film What About Bob? There the protagonist posits, "There are two types of people in the world: those who like Neil Diamond and those who don't." The character of Bob attributes the failure of his marriage to his fiancee's fondness for Diamond.</p>
